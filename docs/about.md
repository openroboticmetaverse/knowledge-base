### **Who are we?**
We are **open robotic metaverse** or in short **orom**, a student initiative currently in the founding process. Our founders are students from RWTH Aachen University and FH Aachen and highly motivated to strengthen the robotic community in and outside of Aachen, Germany.

### **Vision**

We aim to **bring the robotics community together**, both locally and virtually, to encourage collaboration and innovation. Our efforts indirectly support the **acceleration of robotics application development** while **making the technology more accessible**. We help individuals gain skills and knowledge in this field and connect them with companies looking for solution implementers, all while building a connected and passionate community.

### **Mission**

We are creating a platform that helps everyone embrace their experiences with robotics from various angles.

***Key Features***

- **Community**: We are an active community open to professionals, beginners, and enthusiasts alike. We strongly encourage the exchange of knowledge and Ideas.
- **Project Platform**: Our platform enables users to explore different robotics projects, find inspiration, share their projects, or discover collaboration opportunities. *In our vision, we aim to create an open Metaverse where solutions are engineered and showcased. This allows everyone to explore various running solutions, draw inspiration or offer support.*
- **Facilitation Tools**: We provide ready-to-use building blocks that make starting with robotics and simulation quicker and more intuitive.
- **Educational Materials and Mentorship**: We offer an easy-to-follow guide for learning robotics. We encourage a culture of support where the more experienced members assist those newer in the field and we believe that we all can always learn from each other.
- **Bridging Theory and Practice**: We strive to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge found in academic institutions and the practical needs of the industry.
- **Open-Source Involvement:** We contribute to the open-source community and welcome everyone to join our vision.*

***Additional Services***

In parallel to our main activities, we also offer the following:

- **Sim2Real**: We aim to close the gap between simulation and reality. With our partners, we provide access to hardware for testing applications developed in the simulation environment.
- **Incubation Support**: We connect motivated working groups with incubation programs, helping them transform their ideas into startups and thereby accelerate innovation in the robotics field.

**Our Approach**

- **Development**: We are committed to developing valuable building blocks for simulation environments and robotic applications. Furthermore, we encourage the use of open-source libraries to prevent redundant work.
- **Education and Learning**: We are dedicated contributors to our learning platform, emphasizing both content and practical insights.
- **Event Organization and Participation**: We host relevant events, including **presentations** from researchers or startups in the field, as well as **hackathons** combined with **social events** to foster community spirit. Additionally, we aim to actively participate in external events such as ROSCon or Automatica.
- **Collaboration**: We maintain active communication with institutes and researchers in the robotics field. This ensures we remain updated with the latest technologies while also collaborating with the industry to address relevant use cases.
