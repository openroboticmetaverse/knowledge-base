# open robotic metaverse's Knowledge Base

Welcome to the open robotic metaverse Knowledge Base. This repository houses the comprehensive documentation for our projects. Our goal is to provide a central, accessible, and detailed source of information for all things related to our ecosystem.

[![Pages Build Deployment](https://github.com/openroboticmetaverse/knowledge-base/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/openroboticmetaverse/knowledge-base/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)


> :warning: **Note:** This documentation is in the early stages of development.

## Documentation URL

Access the published documentation at [docs.openroboticmetaverse.org](https://docs.openroboticmetaverse.org).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x

### Installation

To work with the documentation locally, you need to install Material for MkDocs. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

This command installs the Material theme for MkDocs, which is used to style our knowledge base.

### Local Development
To preview the documentation site on your local machine, use:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
This command starts a local server and opens up a browser window with your documentation. It features live reloading, so any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the preview.

## Automatic Deployment
We have set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and deploy the documentation site after each commit to the main branch. This ensures that the latest changes are always reflected in the live knowledge base.
